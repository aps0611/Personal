            </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p align="justify">If Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the 18th century philosopher who is known for his contributions to political philosophy and the concept of the social contract, were alive today, he would likely have a complex view of recent developments in modern technology landscape.</p>
          <p align="justify">On one hand he might have believed AI as manifestation of human power and greater control over environment.</p>
          <p align="justify">But, on the other hand:</p>
          <p align="justify">He might have also expressed concerns about the potential negative consequences of AI on human society, such as job displacement, social inequality, and loss of privacy. </p>
          <p align="justify">And I really wonder how might the new social contract in the age of AI might look like!</p>
          <p align="justify">If you have read Rousseau, he was a firm believer of the fact that desire to pursuade others, having control and power over others was most basic human tendency. Thus, the social contract theory as a way to limit these impulses and tendencies in favour of more stable and egalitarian society.[1]</p>
          <p align="justify">What is social contract theory?</p>
          <p align="justify">Social contract theory proposes that individuals surrender some of their individual freedoms and rights to a governing body in exchange for protection and the maintenance of social order.</p>
          <p align="justify">For a moment, think of a race, it is true that one person is always ahead of the other. In the same way, we can think of the relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Government, and the public interest. AI technology is rapidly advancing and leading the way in innovation and development. The government, on the other hand, is tasked with regulating the use of AI to ensure it aligns with public interest and ethical standards. However, there is often a gap between the pace of technological advancement and regulatory measures.</p>
          <p align="justify">While AI is advancing quickly, government regulations struggle to keep up with the pace. Ultimately, the public interest is compromised at some point. Achieving the balance between these three elements is an ongoing challenge.</p>
          <p align="justify">I've created a rough sketch to provide a better perspective on this:</p>
          <p align="justify">Images can often convey information more effectively than words alone. From the image, it is clear that in the current Algorithmic Age, the industry holds a dominant position, which has resulted in a compromise of the social contract in some ways. The rapid advancement of technology and the proliferation of algorithms have given industries an upper hand, which has shifted the balance of power away from individuals and towards big corporations.</p>
          <p align="justify">Should you be worried? </p>
          <p align="justify">Yes!</p>
          <p align="justify">We often click on terms and conditions without reading them and unknowingly give consent to share our personal information, compromising our privacy. With corporations knowing more about us than ever before, we have become easier to manipulate. Do you feel like you want more control over your privacy? It's important to take proactive steps to protect our personal information and ensure that we don't fall victim to potential harm.</p>
          <p align="justify">While I'm not an expert on public policy, I have jotted down some expectations that I have regarding regulations from the government.</p>
          <p align="justify">1. Right to know: Individuals should have the right to know what data is being collected and how much of it is being stored by corporations.</p>
          <p align="justify">2. Right to forget: The right to have oneâ€™s personal information, which is publicly disclosed, removed from the internet. This concept has found global recognition in the European Union, Turkey, Russia, and Siberia. However, in India it still is in nascent stage.[4]</p>
          <p align="justify">3. Right to correct: Any erroneous data that corporations may have about individuals. It is not uncommon for companies to have incorrect information about people, and this can lead to negative consequences for those affected.</p>
          <p align="justify">4. Right to control: Individuals should have the right to control how their personal data is shared with others, and should not have their data shared without their consent.</p>
          <p align="justify">5. Right to object data processing: except when the data processing is in interest of society. </p>
          <p align="justify">By recognizing the importance of these rights and personal autonomy in the digital age, we can work to create a more just and equitable society, where individuals are not forced to conform to the narrow constraints of algorithms and data.</p>
          <p align="justify">I would like to leave you all with a small story to ponder upon before I end my article:</p>
          <p align="justify">In ancient Greece, there was a wise man named Procrustes who owned an iron bed. Procrustes would invite weary travellers to spend the night in his home, offering them a place to rest on his bed. However, there was a catch: if the traveller was too short for the bed, Procrustes would stretch them until they fit. And if the traveller was too tall for the bed, Procrustes would chop off their limbs until they fit. Procrustes believed that his bed was perfect and that everyone should conform to its size. In a way, he was like the algorithms of today's world, which are designed to fit people into certain categories and make assumptions based on data</p>
          <p align="justify">While I may seem cautious about the impact of the Algorithmic Age on our social contract, I am actually quite optimistic about the positive changes it can bring. As long as we maintain our vigilance and fight for our rights, we can harness the power of data and technology to create a more equitable and just society.</p>
          <p align="justify">Until next time,</p>
          <p align="justify">Bon voyage!</p>
