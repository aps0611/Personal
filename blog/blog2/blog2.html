        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p align="justify">Have you ever wondered who will be the next billionaire from data?</p>
          <p align="justify">It's not like the good old days when oil made Arabian countries filthy rich. Data is not like oil, it doesn't come out of the ground with a little elbow grease. No, data is something we generate every day, without even realizing it.</p>
          <p align="justify">But here's the catch, even though we're producing more data than ever before, most of us can't seem to monetize it.</p>
          <p align="justify">Who will be the lucky ones to strike it rich from data?</p>
          <p align="justify">Will it be the tech giants like Google and Facebook, who have been hoarding our data for years?</p>
          <p align="justify">or</p>
          <p align="justify">Will it be some scrappy up-and-comer who figures out how to turn all that data into cold, hard cash?</p>
          <p align="justify">That's not the million-dollar question.. The tech giants are already leading the race.</p>
          <p align="justify">One thing is for sure, data is becoming an increasingly valuable resource in today's digital economy. From social media interactions to online purchases, we're constantly generating new data points that companies can use to gain insights and create targeted marketing campaigns.</p>
          <p align="justify">The more data a company has, the better equipped they are to make informed decisions, and the more valuable that data becomes. But as individuals, we often feel like we're getting the short end of the stick. We're providing all this data, but we're not reaping the rewards.</p>
          <p align="justify">I'm contemplating delving into an investigation of how different countries compare when it comes to their privacy policies, and data regulations, but that's a topic for another blog post.</p>
          <p align="justify">Today I am more interested in visualising who generates the most data.</p>
          <p align="justify">There are several factors to consider when measuring a country's digital footprint, but the figure below specifically focuses on internet penetration as an indicator of a country's level of data generation.</p>
          <div>
            <iframe width="750" height="450" src="https://lookerstudio.google.com/embed/reporting/9598ba8b-df9e-430a-90b3-233f3adccf97/page/0CIKD" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>
          
          
          <p align="justify">In the current digital landscape, the amount of data generated by individuals, companies, and even entire countries can be seen as a measure of their level of digital engagement and connectivity. However, it's not necessarily the case that generating less data puts individuals or countries at a disadvantage position.</p>
          <p align="justify">For example, some individuals may choose to limit the amount of personal data they share online for privacy reasons, while others may not have access to the same technology and connectivity that allows for high levels of data generation. Additionally, some countries may prioritize data privacy and security over the free flow of data, leading to lower levels of data generation.</p>
          <p align="justify">It's important to remember that generating more data doesn't necessarily equate to greater success or prosperity. While data can certainly provide valuable insights and opportunities for innovation, it's just one piece of the puzzle. Other factors such as education, infrastructure, and economic stability can also play a significant role in determining a country's success and competitiveness in the global market.</p>
          <p align="justify">In short, while generating more data can certainly be an advantage in certain contexts, it's not the only factor that determines success or disadvantage in the digital age.</p>
